DEG FLASHER
===========

Tool for flashing AMD RX Series cards(RX 470, RX 480, RX 570, RX 580) so they can mine at better hashing powers. It goes to a backend server(http://flasher.degconnect.com/) to check if modded BIOS is already there and download and flash the card with the modded ROM.

If the modded BIOS is not there it will backup anyways the BIOS to http://flasher.degconnect.com/ and it will alert Degconnect team so they can tweek the BIOS as soon as possible. Once that the team updates the system with the modded BIOS a message es sent to the user who ask for that BIOS.
